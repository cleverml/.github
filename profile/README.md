# About Us ðŸ§ª

We aim to leverage generative algorithms to solve problems across various modalities.

## Projects

### **CleverChain** ðŸ¤–
A collection of **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** agents that work together to control a virtual development environment. **CleverChain** uses vision transformers, document loaders, and retrieval to sense its environment. It accesses a novel 'REPL' environment to execute code, run shell commands, and interact with browsers and GUIs.

CleverChain breaks challenging requests down into sequences of tasks, iteratively enriching its context window with new information at each step.

### **CleverGARS** ðŸŽ¨
Our **Generative Art Recommendation System (GARS)** uses live feedback to enhance the stable diffusion process. GARS produces stunning and relevant generative artwork by generating prompt embeddings and then performing informed vector space navigation.
