# About Us
We are a lab that leverages generative algorithms to solve problems across various modalities.

## Projects
### CleverGARS
Our Generative Art Recommendation System (GARS) uses live feedback to enhance the stable diffusion process. GARS produces stunning and relevant generative artwork by generating prompt embeddings and then performing informed vector space navigation.

### CleverChain
CleverChain is a collection of advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agents that work together to control machines.

Together, these agents can provision cloud services, generate and execute code, fix and debug errors, browse the web, and communicate with humans and each other.
